## Budget Alerts

ocsight warns you at configurable thresholds:

- **Warning**: Default 70% of budget
- **Critical**: Default 90% of budget
- **Forecast**: Projects month-end overspending

## Smart Forecasting

The budget forecast uses conservative estimates:

- Early month: 30% reduction for variability
- Actual active days calculation
- Real-time spending patterns

Example output:

```
