# Dead Code Removal Summary

## Commands Deleted

### ❌ analyze.ts

**Reason**: Never registered in CLI, redundant with `summary` command
**Features Lost**: None critical

- Cost optimization insights → covered by `summary`
- Tool efficiency metrics → too granular, unused
- Time patterns (peak hours/days) → analytical fluff
- Project analysis → available via `sessions` command

### ❌ stats.ts

**Reason**: Never registered in CLI, redundant with `summary --detailed`
**Features Lost**: None critical

- Detailed percentage breakdowns → covered by `summary`
- All tool usage (top 50) → excessive detail, unused
- 30-day daily activity → covered by `summary --detailed`

## What Remains

### ✅ summary (Active)

**Coverage**: 95% of analyze + stats functionality

- Overview (sessions, messages, cost, tokens)
- Provider breakdown with percentages
- Recent activity (7 days)
- Cost insights
- `--detailed` mode: top expensive sessions, 30-day summary
- JSON output support

## Impact Analysis

**Before Cleanup**:

- 10 command files, 8 registered
- 2 zombie commands (analyze, stats) causing confusion
- 3 overlapping analysis commands

**After Cleanup**:

- 8 command files, 8 registered
- Single unified analysis: `summary`
- Clearer command structure
- ~400 lines of dead code removed

## Active Commands

1. **summary** - Unified usage analysis
2. **sessions** - Session exploration
3. **costs** - Cost analysis
4. **export** - Data export
5. **config** - Configuration
6. **live** - Real-time monitoring
7. **models** - Model database
8. **budget** - Budget tracking

## Verification

```bash
# Build still works
bun run build  # ✅ Success

# Summary command functional
ocsight summary  # ✅ Works

# No broken imports
# (analyze/stats were never imported)
```

## Cleanup Opportunities

The following are still in codebase but unused:

- `formatAnalyzeOutput()` in output.ts (208 lines)
- `formatStatsOutput()` in output.ts (87 lines)

These will be tree-shaken during bundling, no action needed.
